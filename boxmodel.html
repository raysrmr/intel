            Mayank Agarwal's fight to reclaim his place in Indian Test eleven starts on Tuesday
             when he walks out to open in a three-day game against 'County Select XI', starting here 
             tomorrow as best friend KL Rahul gears up to keep wickets in Rishabh Pant's absence.

The match has been accorded first-class status, a first for India in many years since Mahendra 
Singh Dhoni took over captain. The Jharkhand dasher believed that an "official match" robbed all
 players from getting some game time.
